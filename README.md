# Pac-Man AI Implementations

## search
Implementation of A* search to find the shortest path to a pellet in the absence of ghosts.

## multiagent
Implementations of Pac-Man AI's using minimax and expectimax search to avoid ghosts while maximizing the score.

## reinforcement
Implementations of standard Pac-Man using reinforcement learning; both value iteration (model-based) and Q-learning (model-free).

## ghostbusters
Bayesian Networks and Hidden Markov Models used to create a Pac-Man AI that hunts ghosts using a sensor with a certain probability of accuracy.
